# This project has been moved

The continuation of LWJRE is Ardent Engine and it has been moved to Codeberg: [codeberg.org/HexagonNico/ArdentEngine](https://codeberg.org/HexagonNico/ArdentEngine)

## Light Weight Java Rendering Engine

LWJRE is a graphics and physics engine that was developed for a bachelor thesis.

I will keep this repository up in case I want to expand on the project in the future.
